## Joe Kendzicky

Hi I'm Joe Kendzicky. I've been involved in crypto dating back to 2013 and have worked in the industry full-time since graduating university in 2017.
Currently I am Head of Research at Accomplice-Coinlist Venture Fund. I also oversee portfolio strategy for a small crypto investment fund I co-founded in early 2018, and assist in analyzing private-side deal flow for a small group of crypto angel investors.

My strengths and passions lie in deeper analytical research particularly across DeFi and L1 consensus systems. I am a founding partner
at <a href="https://greymatter.capital">Greymatter Capital</a> and an early member in [Analyst Dao](https://twitter.com/AnalystDao), where I have 
published extensive research reports on AMMs, derivative DEXs, lending protocols and decentralized stablecoins. Historically, I have
also authored technical reports on Bitcoin protocol innovations from my [medium profile](https://medium.com/@jkendzicky16).
